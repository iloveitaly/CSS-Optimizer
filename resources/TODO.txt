Hi There,

Thanks for making this tool—it’ll be useful!

I have a couple of suggestions:
* It’d be nice to have the option of stripping double carriage
returns, both in-rule and between rules:
.test {
   display: float;

}
->
.test {
   display: float;
}

And

.test {
   display: float;
}

.test1 {
   display: inline;
}
->
.test {
   display: float;
}
.test1 {
   display: inline;
}

* I personally use comments in strange places, and would like to see
comment position maintained (ie not moved to the next line). eg
/* @group testing */
.test { /* this is sample code */
   width: 20% /* =240px */
} /* trailing comment */

Of these comments the first and last are unchanged, but the middle two
are moved to new lines.

* Finally I noticed that the formatter picks up on “;” in comments, eg
/* this is a comment; it’s pretty useless */
becomes
/* this is a comment;
   it’s pretty useless */

While you probably want to format CSS inside comments, it’d be good to
restrict ‘return after ;’ to inside {}

Thanks again
