In 1996, I embarked on a career in photography and discovered my special niche in life. I started my photography career as an assistant, learning the basics and technical aspects, as well as the traditional way of photographing weddings. While quickly progressing from assistant to second to main photographer, I learned many aspects of the new approaches to photographing weddings--the photojournalistic, the documentary, the architectural, the romantic, the Fine Art, and the advertising approaches.<br>&nbsp;</br>
I have learned that my outgoing, eager personality is an asset in developing a rapport with the &quot;client&quot; which has helped me capture those &quot;special moments&quot;. I find that I value and take pride in memorializing people's biggest life events. What I appreciate most is the ability to capture the spontaneous emotions and expressions of someone's wedding  or special event day and presenting them with images that will allow you to preserve those feelings throughout your lives.<br>&nbsp;</br>
Whether you need your special event coverage captured with film or digital film, advanced professional 35mm, advanced professional medium format or advanced a digital camera systems, non-posed/photojournalism/documentary, posed/traditional, fine-art, advertising, commercial, fashion, photonaturalistic photography, color or black and white; at ajourney we will listen to your needs in an honest, trustworthy, compassionate, and sincere way.  My practice is dedicated solely to excellence in weddings and any type of special events; such as; Bar/Bat Mitzvahs, corporate events, quincea&ntilde;eros and the like.  We are here to preserve your day memories; to preserved them in time.  You'll will see that our photography is like no other.  We are reinventing photography all together.<br>

When describing the legacy of the French photojournalist, Henri Cartier-Bresson (1908-2004), Elliot Erwitt says: &quot;He can only get better with age.  People's clothes change, automobiles change, but the eye and the emotion, that does not change.  In other words, even though one of the photographers greatest masters is gone, the &quot;decisive moments&quot; he captured are not going anywhere.<br>
