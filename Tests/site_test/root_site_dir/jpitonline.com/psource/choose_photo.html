<p class="header">QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD ASK YOUR PHOTOGRAPHER</p>
<p class="header">EXPERIENCE LEVEL</p>
<p>Has this person photographed other special events, including weddings? Does she/he do this for living or for fun? In this industry, photographers come and go daily. A brand new one may be pretty good, and everyone has to start somewhere, but do you want to trust the once in a lifetime event to a newcomer or a part-timer?</p>
<p class="header">PHOTOGRAPHIC STYLE</p>
<p>Are the images that you are shown, what you would like to see in your final album/book? Can you picture yourself photographed the same way? Is there a satisfactory mix of different styles? There are &ldquo;buzz&rdquo; words flying about everywhere about photojournalism, formal, classic contemporary, and so on. All colorful adjectives aside, do &ldquo;YOU&rdquo; like it? How about considering a wedding/event PHOTONATURALIST?</p>
<p class="header">TRUTH IN ADVERTISING</p>
<p>Is this the photographer that will be photographing your event or will they send in who ever are available? Don&rsquo;t be shocked, this happens more often than you can imagine. Be certain that you know which is going to be there and see her/his work and meet with them. Ask them to show you a complete wedding coverage of their own not just 100 different images of their best work. The &ldquo;fine&rdquo; professional artist will show you 40 to 100 images in a book or album of one particular Wedding that shows the complete coverage, such as; the house/hotel preparation stage, the departing stage, the ceremony stage, the family portraits stage, the individual portrait stage, the reception stage; all in all, the entire day coverage.</p>
<p class="header">PERSONALITY</p>
<p>Is the photographer that you meet someone that you can get along with? Is the &ldquo;chemistry&rdquo; there? Do you &ldquo;click&rdquo; with this person? People have walked away from hairstylists and tailors for less. This is a person that you are going to spend most of the day with, an important day. Could you handle it? Does she/he seem service oriented and someone you can handle during your day?</p>
<p class="header">APPEARANCE</p>
<p>Ask the photographer how she/he intends to dress. The last thing that you want is a conflict at the event about the photographer wearing a sweatshirt and jeans with sneakers. Is this person well groomed?</p>
<p class="header">PRICE RANGE</p>
<p>Although, the last thing you want to do is shop by<i> &ldquo;price&rdquo;</i>; Is this person within your budget? If not, is he or she worth the difference? A lot of times we tend to surpass our budget constraints to get what we really want. If you see and like it, you&rsquo;ll find a way. In any case, make sure you understand what everything costs, including reorders.</p>
<p class="header">DELIVERY</p>
<p>How long does it take to get your assembled image album back, your finished albums or books, your portraits? Go ahead and ask. Some photographers take
months to deliver your albums.</p>
<p class="header">OFFERING</p>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s a la Carte or packages do you understand what you get? Is there any room for changes and will it cost to do so? Sometimes packages are fixed, sometimes they can be customized, in any case, ask. How much time will she/he spend customizing your order? What if you need more time? Make sure that you know what&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p class="header">CONTRACT</p>
<p>Do you understand the contract? Is it fair? Is everything spelled out? When it comes down to going to court, only what is WRITTEN really counts, not what was promised or verbally said. Make sure that you have no doubts before signing. Read it ALL; several times.</p>
<h3>FIND SOMEONE WHO CARES MORE ABOUT YOUR NEEDS AND DESIRES THAN THEY DO ABOUT THEIR OWN PACKAGES AND POLICIES</h3>
<p>Someone who will help you plan everything, so your event will run smoothly and efficiently, thus, you will get all the images you were hoping for.</p>
<p class="header">ASK ABOUT THEIR GUARANTEES!!!</p>
<p>They should have some sort of performance guarantee&mdash;GET IT IN WRITING! If something did not come out the way you expected, they should offer to recreate it somehow! As of this writing, one performance guarantee is to hire someone that photograph on speculation. In other words, you may pay a design fee for an album containing the images, you select a main album/book of your preference, then, you select the images that will be used to design the main album/book, after you have seen the images of the complete coverage.</p>
