<p class="header" style="text-align:center;">HOW TO AVOID THE TEN MOST COMMON MAKEUP MISTAKES ON YOUR WEDDING DAY</p>
<p align="center"><i><b>All eyes will be on you&mdash;make sure every inch is worthy of close-up attention!</b></i></p>
<p class="header">1. DO USE PROPER SKIN CARE</p><p> Give nature a helping hand by starting a basic skin care program 2-3 months prior to your wedding. A morning and evening regimen of cleaning, freshening and moisturizing primes your face for the sheer makeup look brides love.</p>
<p class="header">2. DO WEAR MAKEUP</p>
<p>Use makeup to accentuate, enhance and define your best features. Minor imperfections may be neatly corrected by using a concealer. The important thing is to experiment before your wedding day.</p>
<p class="header">3. DO USE COLOR HARMONY</p>
<p> To harmonize, choose makeup and clothes with a single undertone&mdash;either vibrantly cool or radiantly warm. Make sure you harmonize lip color, cheek color, and nail color (if necessary)-many brides are opting not to color their nails but to only use a clear nail polish color. The entire bridal party should apply this rule. Neutral browns photograph the best.</p>
<p class="header">4. DO USE WATERPROOF MASCARA</p><p> This is one of the happiest moments of your life, and you&rsquo;ll </p>
<p>undoubtedly shed a few tears! Layer brown and black mascara for longer looking lashes.</p>
<p class="header">5. DO USE LIPSTICK AND LIPLINER</p><p> Select a lipstick rich in moisturizers and emollients for the ultimate in kissable lips. Line first, and then use a brush to apply color. Reapply for staying power.</p>
<p>Add a touch of gloss for shine, but avoid frosted lipstick.</p>
<p class="header">6. DO USE TRANSLUCENT FACE POWDER</p>
<p> This sets makeup and provides a matte finish. It also helps control oil breakthrough and shine. Always select powder in the shade closest to your natural skin tone. Pressed powder is portable and can be used throughout the day.</p>
<p class="header">7. DO WEAR THE CORRECT FOUNDATION SHADE</p><p> Select a shade that matches your skin at the jaw line (not the back of your hand) and blend it well&mdash;especially along the hairline and jaw. This gives your skin a smooth, even finish.</p>
<p class="header">8. DO USE CORRECT BLUSHER APPLICATION</p><p> Blusher should provide a soft glow, and never look streaked or blotchy. For sheer and even application, use a blusher brush. Whenever you lay the brush first is where the most color will be deposited. Lightly dust face powder over blusher to tone.</p>
<p class="header">9. DO WEAR A FRAGRANCE</p><p> A woman&rsquo;s fragrance is her personal signature&mdash;and an intimate trademark. Never overdo your aroma. Make sure you use layering techniques with your scent&mdash;applying body creams, dusting powders and colognes in a matching scent.</p>
<p class="header">10. DO USE A PROFESSIONAL</p><p> Beautiful skin care and glamour isn&rsquo;t something you buy&mdash;it&rsquo;s something you learn. Learning the right beauty regimen for your skin and proper makeup application will guarantee you&rsquo;ll look your best.</p>
