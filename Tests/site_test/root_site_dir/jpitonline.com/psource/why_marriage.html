<p><span class="header">Why Marriage</span><br>by Mary Nicols</br></p>
<p>Because to the depths of me, I long to love one person, with all my heart, my soul, my mind, my body...</p>
<p>Because I need a forever friend to trust with the intimacies of me, who won&rsquo;t hold them against me, who loves me when I&rsquo;m unlikable, who sees the small child in me. And</p>
<p>who looks for the divine potential of me</p>
<p>Because I need to cuddle in the warmth of the night</p>
<p>with someone who thanks God for me,</p>
<p>with someone I feel blessed to hold</p>
<p>Because marriage means opportunity to grow in love and in friendship</p>
<p>Because marriage is a discipline to be added to a list of achievements</p>
<p>Because marriages do not fail, people fail when they enter in to marriage expecting another to make them whole</p>
<p>Because, knowing this, I promise myself to take full responsibility</p>
<p>for my spiritual, mental and physical wellness</p>
<p>I create me, I take half of the responsibility for my marriage together we create our marriage</p>
<p>Because with this understanding the possibilities are limitless </p>
