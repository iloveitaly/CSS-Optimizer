<p class="header">DESIGNING THE PERFECT LOVE PORTRAIT </p>
<p>Here at ajourney , we understand that your Love Portrait is going to be the beginning of a new adventure in your life. We want to document this special time for you and begin capturing memories that last a lifetime!
To ensure your portrait is as beautiful as it can be, try to follow these suggested guidelines:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Schedule your portrait a minimum of six to eight weeks prior to your wedding day. The sooner the better! This allows adequate time for lab processing.</li>
  <li>Choose outfits that suit your personality and make you feel attractive! Make sure you create color harmony and both outfits coordinate well together. Please do not wear shorts or skirts. This makes posing more difficult. Long, flowing dresses, jeans, or khakis make better selection.</li>
  <li>Start thinking about props! This can make your photograph unique. Consider a picnic basket with wine glasses and a blanket, a straw hat, a musical instrument&mdash;even animals! We can also utilize larger objects (of your selections) such as: boats, sport cars, planes, or motorcycles. </li>
  <li>Don&rsquo;t worry about the location! Once you chose your wardrobe and schedule an appointment, we will discuss location and time with you. We have access to many secret hideaways&mdash;just tell us what you envision. We can create the rest.</li>
  <li>Become alert to interesting photographs. Look out for romantic postcards or magazine advertisements. We can often recreate art with you as the subject.</li>
  <li>Keep in mind that many couples chose to utilize their Love Portrait to display at their reception (perhaps in one of our ajourney signature level portraits), or to include in the invitations, or to distribute framed/mounted images as the perfect party favor or bridal party gift.</li>
  <li>While we are creating your Love Portrait, if you have a sister, a brother, a best friend, a family member you would like a portrait of, bring them along. We can just easily do two or three sittings at the same time as one. Give your family (Mom and Dad) that family portrait they have always wanted! Please discuss your ideas when scheduling your session.</li>
  <li>Most importantly, just <b>HAVE FUN!</b></li>
</ol>
