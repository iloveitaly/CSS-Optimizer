<p class="header">TO KEEP YOU ON TRACK BAT/BAR MITZVAH</p>
<p>Because a Bar/Bat Mitzvah is such a milestone in a young person&rsquo;s life, it requires a lot of planning&mdash; at least one to two years in advance. Due to the special nature of this landmark lifetime event, if you can afford to, it is highly recommended that you hire a special event coordinator experienced in planning Bar/Bat Mitzvahs. This will help ensure all the details are covered and enable you and your family to relax and enjoy the day. </p>
