<p class="header">ABOUT YOUR BUDGET</p>
<p class="header">&ldquo;WEDDING PLANNERS&rdquo; SHOULD ADVICE YOU ABOUT THIS!!!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remember, after the special event day is over all you will have got left is your spouse, your family, the rings and your photographs.</li>
      <li>The food is gone. The cake is gone. So are the cocktails, champagne/beverage. The dress&mdash;as beautiful as it may be, it will not be worn again. And, if you are really lucky, your flowers will make it through the whole day without wilting (if it is August, do not count on it).</li>
      <li>All these things that you spend a fortune on are expendables, yet most of your budget seems to be spent on these expendable one-time-use things. The whole budget seems to be spent on the party.</li>
      <li>A grand party is delightful and fun, but will your guests remember a month after the special event what kind of appetizers you served, or what the centerpiece looked like? This is just one person's opinion, but you really could drop one of the appetizers&mdash;I promise&mdash;your guests will still show up&mdash;guaranteed!</li>
      <li>If your budget is truly an issue, then you will need to be even more selective&mdash;The cheapest photographer is very likely to be the least qualified for the job! That means&mdash;the worst possible person for the job<b>!!!</b></li>
    </ul>
<p class="header"><b>ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS...</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>It's unwise to pay too much&mdash;but it's worse to pay too little. When you pay too much, you lose a little money...that is all. When you pay too little, you sometimes lose everything because the thing you bought was incapable of doing the thing it was bought to do. The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot...it can't be done. If you deal with the lowest bitter, it is well to add something for the risk you take, and if you do that you will have enough to pay for something better.</i>

	</ul>

<ul>
      <li>And if they seem expensive&mdash;compare the photographer that will be shooting your special event with others, at least 4 others&mdash;get to know your photographer's personality&mdash;even if you think you are investing reasonable amounts of money; <b>EXPENSIVE DOES NOT ALWAYS MEANS BETTER!!!</b></li>
      <li>When planning your budget, you may want to consider just inviting ten less guests to your special event&mdash;Now, before you get upset&mdash;let me qualify this point:</li>
</ul>
<p>On average, it cost at least $60 per guest to seat and feed them at the reception. So cutting out just 10 people would give you at least $600 more to spend on the one thing that last forever&mdash;THE PHOTOGRAPHS! If this still upset you see below:</p>
<p><b>&middot;</b><b> </b>Some studios now offer a &ldquo;Bridal Registry&rdquo; I personally call it a &ldquo;Unique Registry&rdquo;. This could be a great option if your needs or desires outweigh your budgetary restrictions. The average special event gift costs between $50-$100. Lets say $50 to be safe.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Even if only 10 of your guests put $50 in to a registry account you would have $500 more to spend on your photography. (You could even use this idea to fund a down payment on a home, but for now lets worry about professional photography! Also&mdash;some studios accept credit cards&mdash;that is a way to extend your payment over a greater period of time. Remember no matter how much...or how little you spend on your special event photography, if you are not happy with the finished images, <b>you have wasted your money! </b>But if you love them, <b>consider it an investment&mdash;you will treasure for a lifetime!</b></li>
</ul>
<p class="header">ASK QUESTIONS</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>EXPERIENCE</b>: always ask how long they have been in Business. Are they a full-time professional photographer, or a weekend photographer that actually does some other job to pay the bills?</li>
  <li><b>EVEN IF THEY ARE PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHERS: </b>ask them what kind of photography they practice? There are many professional photographers which do not enjoy photographing weddings or events, they rather photograph stills, such as, flowers, bottles, mountains, trees&mdash;anything that does not move; and if it moves, some photograph animals&mdash;elephants, tigers, frogs, sharks, gorillas, children, etc. REMEMBER A WEDDING IS A SPECIAL EVENT TREAT IT AS SUCH; NOT ALL PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHERS ARE COMPLETELY EQUIPPED AND TRAINED...</li>
  <li><b>DO THEY WORK BY THEMSELVES, WITH AN ASSISTANT PHOTOGRAPHER, WITH LIGHTING ASSISTANCE, WITH MAIN PHOTOGRAPHERS, WITH PHOTOJOURNALISTS...PLEASE ASK, AND DON'T BE INTIMIDATED...THEIR ANSWERS WILL TELL YOU A LOT ABOUT THEIR QUALITY OF WORK</b></li>
  <li><b>WHAT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT DO THEY HAVE?</b> Advanced 35mm systems, in conjunction with various lenses ranging from extra-wide angle to portrait lenses&mdash;Do they know what image stabilization means? Do they use Medium Format cameras? The brand of the camera is very important; for instance Canon or Nikon, Hasselblat or Bronicas. ARE THEY FULLY EQUIPED WITH DIGITAL EQUIPMENT...DO THEY USE ADVANCED DIGITAL CAMERAS? Most importantly, look at their work...Do you like what you see? Remember, it is your wedding not theirs...</li>
  <li><b>IF YOU HIRE A PARTICULAR STUDIO</b> Is the person I am speaking to about my special event really the person who will photograph it? When you call the studio, weeks after the first consultation; Is the photographer available? Or he/she is never available to talk with you&mdash;and indication that he/she is not a full-time professional photographer.</li>
  <li><b>REMEMBER, SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIRST SPEAK TO THE STUDIO OWNER OR </b><b>MANAGER</b>&mdash;then they may job it out to one of their associates or what frequently they call &ldquo;partners&rdquo; whom you might not meet until the day of your special event. Make sure you are planning your special event with the right person&mdash;THE PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHER WHO IS GOING TO BE PHOTOGRAPHING YOUR EVENT!!!</li>
  <li><b>WILL THE PHOTOGRAPHER TAKE THE TIME TO VISIT ALL LOCATIONS</b> where your special event will take place, prior to the day? Scouting locations tells the photographer where the best places to set up are, and how the natural light falls at a particular time of the day. This will help in the planning of the posed photographs, and what type of additional lighting will be necessary. </li>
  <li><b>HOW MANY SPECIAL EVENTS THE PHOTOGRAPHER BE HANDLING THE WEEKEND OF YOUR WEDDING?</b> The Maximum should be 3&mdash;no more than 4&mdash;that way you can always know your photographer. Is it possible they may be over-extending themselves?</li>
  <li><b>WHAT TYPE OF GUARANTEE DO I RECEIVE REGARDING PORTRAIT PERMANENCE AND QUALITY OF THE FINAL PRODUCT?</b> Higher-quality studios are now offering lifetime Guarantees, not only on the albums/books, but also on the photographs themselves. What happens if an image fades over the years&mdash;will it be replaced free of charge? </li>
  <li><b>IS PRINT RETOUCHING INCLUDED?</b><b> </b>Most photographers do not include retouching as part of their &ldquo;package&rdquo;. Retouching of your portraits can be extremely important! Unwanted blemishes, dark circles or scars can be permanently removed from your prints. But, if it is not included in the price, retouching can add hundreds of dollars to your final bill. Please make sure retouching is included at no extra charge!</li>
  <li><b>ARE THERE ANY LIMITATIONS?</b> Are there any time limits? Do they limit the number of exposures they take? Do they limit the number of locations?</li>
  <li><b>WHAT BETTER PROOF THAN A SAMPLE ALBUM/BOOK OF A COMPLETE COVERAGE SOMETIMES WHEN </b>THEY SHOW YOU ALBUMS; THESE ALBUMS CONTAIN THEIR BEST WORK FROM DIFFERENT WEDDINGS </li>
  <li><b>DO THEY HAVE INFORMATION THEY CAN SEND YOU?</b> Get all information you can up front, it makes your research more efficient. If you can go over their information, brochures, etc. prior to making an appointment to meet with them, you will save a great deal of time. If they have no information to send you, do not bother with them! Reputable studios will send you information.</li>
  <li><b>PAYMENT FLEXIBILITY</b> Will you be charged up-front for a package of images you have never even seen yet? Are there other alternative methods of payment, such as credit cards? Can you hire the photographer for the day, and upgrade after you have seen the entire coverage? Are there financing options? See if they have some sort of organized Bridal Registry-Unique Registry.</li>
</ul>
<p class="header">ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT POINTS TO REMEMBER</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>YOUR SPECIAL EVENT DAY IS A TRUE &ldquo;ONCE IN A LIFETIME&rdquo; EVENT</b><b>&mdash;</b>It should be recorded sensitively and accurately&mdash;by a qualified professional Wedding/Event/Portrait Photographer!</li>
  <li><b>IF YOU ARE ON A STRICT BUDGET, YOU WILL NEED TO BE EXTREMELY PICKY ABOUT CHOOSING THE RIGHT PHOTOGRAPHER--</b><b>THE CHEAPEST PHOTOGRAPHER</b> is very likely to be the <b>LEAST QUALIFIED</b>&mdash;this is one time that you get what you pay for!</li>
  <li><b>QUALITY, SERVICE AND VALUE</b>&mdash;The only things worth insisting on.</li>
  <li><b>UNFORTUNATELY, THE PHOTOGRAPHER IS ONE OF THE LAST PEOPLE CONSIDERED AND HIRED FOR A SPECIAL EVENT, INCLUDING WEDDINGS</b><b>--</b> The best photographers will most likely be booked up well in advanced&mdash;Do not wait until the last minute&mdash;Although, you might be lucky enough to find a fine professional photographer in the early stages of their business able to do a very good job.</li>
  <li><b>AS MUCH AS YOU MIGHT WANT TO, PLEASE, DO NOT LET YOUR UNCLE/AUNT/NEIGHBOR PHOTOGRAPH YOUR SPECIAL EVENT IN PLACE OF A QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL WEDDING/SPECIAL EVENT/PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHER!!!</b> In the beginning this might sound like a good idea&mdash;(aunt/uncle-G's pictures from his/her trip to Yosemite look pretty good AND HOW ABOUT THOSE BEAUTIFUL IMAGES THEY PHOTOGRAPHED IN PUERTO RICO, SPAIN, FRANCE, ITALY, AFRICA AND POLAND)&mdash;the price is certainly right, BUT the benefit of low cost or not cost at all, does not outweigh the inability to anticipate and capture the moments of your day, the poor lighting and posing skills, and the absence of professional equipment and professional retouching. Do it right the first time&mdash;you will not waste your time and money.</li>
