<p>Flash is a technology that allows your web-site to incorporate sound, video, animation, dynamic effects,
and external data sources to provide the user of your Flash site with rich, interactive web experience.</p>
<p>The most common use for Flash-based sites are picture galleries, dynamic web applications such as shopping carts, or a site that intergrates video or sound into its interface.
Flash based sites are not commonly used for sites that would consist of alot of text.</p>
<p>If you want some of your site to be Flash you can intergrate Flash into a HTML based site. 
This allows some of your site to have features such as dynamic photo galleries or video, while other parts might consist of a HTML based design.</p>
<p>Flash also excells at connecting with external data sources. This makes Flash a create solution for creating database based sites like a shopping cart, or a messaging system. 
In this respect the possibilities with flash are nearly endless</p>
