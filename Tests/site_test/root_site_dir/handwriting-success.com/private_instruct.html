          <td>Private occupational therapy evaluation and intervention is available for children and teenagers.&nbsp; Children, teens and adults can participate in private handwriting instruction.&nbsp;Private sessions are ideal for some students&nbsp;for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; I often recommend private instruction for people who:
			<ul>
			<li>Have specific occupational therapy (i.e. sensory integration) needs</li>
			<li>Benefit from reduced distraction</li>
			<li>Live in the Downingtown area</li>
			<li>simply prefer private session to the small group</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The private sessions are usually 1-hour classes.</p>
			<p>
		    They are provided in the Downingtown office.</p>
			<p>
		    Sessions are usually scheduled weekly.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>Sessions&nbsp;are&nbsp;scheduled&nbsp;according to availability.&nbsp; </p>
			<p>
	        Saturday sessions are available. </p>
