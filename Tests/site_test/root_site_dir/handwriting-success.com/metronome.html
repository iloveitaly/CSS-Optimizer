          <td><h2 align="center">What is it?</h2>
            <p>The <i>Interactive Metrnome</i> (IM) program is used to enchance a person's motor sequencing, timing, and coordination skills. These skills can also promote learning! They are involved in sensory motor regulation and the ability to focus and attend.</p>
            <p>The<i> Interactive Metronome</i>  is a PC-based interactive version of the traditional music metronome. Hand and foot sensors are used to objectively measure a users performance as he attempts to move to a fixed metronome beat. The user performs thirteen different movement patterns to address coordination, motor senquencing and timing skills. </p>
            <p>The standard training program is organized into 15 sessions which are ideally completed in a 3-5 week period. The IM's patented auditory guidance system progressively challenges the students to stay closer to the beat. Trainees are rewarded for each &quot;personal best&quot; score achieved along their path to their ultimate performance goals. Trainees may require additional sessions to reach their goals. Some benefit from pre-training &quot;synchronization&quot; sessions to assist them in meeting the demands of the standard training program.</p>
            <h2 align="center">Expert's Responses</h2>
          <p>&quot;Attention, learning and problem solving depend in part on the ability to plan and sequence actions and ideas. The <i>Interactive Metronome</i> helps individuals systematically exercise and often improve basic motor planning and sequencing capacities.&quot;<br>
            <i>-Stanley Greenspan MD, noted child psychologist and ex-head of NIMH</i></p>
          <p>&quot;The <i>Interactive Metronome</i> is spectacularly helpful. It is one of the most promising developments with <i>non-medication of ADHD</i> that's come along in a lone while. This is a really solid extremely helpful non-medication (intervention) not only for ADHD but for mental functioning in general.&quot;<br>
            <i>-Edward Hallowell MD, author of 'Driven to Distraction' and leading clinician and speaker on ADHD</i></p>
          <p>&quot;I have found <i>IM</i> is helpful in the motor and sequencing aspects of language as well as attention and motor coordination&quot;<br>
            <i>-LorRainne Jones, MA CCC, SLP, PhD, author of the book 'For Parents and Professionals: Expressive Language Delay&quot;</i></p>
          <p>&quot;In our clinical experience, <i>IM</i> training appears to address spatial problems at the neural level- preparing the brain to be receptive to learning and because of the repetitions it becomes automatic.&quot;<br>
            <i>-Barbara Fisher, PhD, a Neuropsychologist and head of Cognitive Precision Therapy</i></p>
          <h2 align="center">Research:</h2>
          <p>Effect of <i>Interactive Metronome</i> Rhythmicity Training On Children With ADHD.<br>
            <i>Results:</i> The <i>IM</i> group showed statistically significant improvements over both control, language processing, reading, and in their ability to regulate aggression.</p>
          <p>Archdiocese of Miami administer the Woodcock Johnson 3rd edition nationally standardized test to students pro and post completing <i>IM</i> training. <i>Results:</i></p>
          <ul>
            <li> Reading Fluency increased by 1.91 grade levels.</li>
            <li>Math Fluency increased by 1.11 grade levels grade levels.</li>
            <li>Mental Processing speed increased by 2.62 grade levels</li>
            <li>2/3 of students increased GPA by an average of .374 points.</li>
            <li>Some students reported SAT scored 80-100 points higher</li>
            </ul>
          <p>World Scientific Golf Trust- study concluded that IM training improves golf accuracy as well as other complex motor activities.</p>
          <p>&quot;Imprtoving Special Ed. Student Motor Intergration by use of <i>Interactive Metronome</i>.&quot;- Demostrated the <i>Interactive Metronome's</i> effectiveness in improving fine and visual motor coordination of special education students. Parents post study observations of improvements in cognitive and behavioral areas led to more comprehensive IM studies to also document the &quot;IM effect&quot; in these areas.</p>
          <h2 align="center">Testimonials From Parents of  Metronome Trainee's </h2>
          <p><i>&quot;His PE teacher asked 'What did you do with your son this summer? He is in control of his body now and has so much more confidence.&quot; </i>(most parents report improved sports skills)</p>
          <p><i>&quot;Profound change in her ability to concentrate and complete day-to-day tasks (including school work) in a timely manner. Organization is overall improved.&quot;</i></p>
          <p><i>&quot;He's easier to get along with.&quot; </i></p>
          <p><i>&quot;Dramatic improvement in her writing skills, closed the gap between oral and written expression.&quot;</i></p>
          <p><i>&quot;He sits and does his homework without a struggle, he allows me to help him now when he needs it.&quot;</i></p>
          <p><i>&quot;She is more aware of what is going on around her. She isn't bumping into people or being in their space. She also improved her ability to stick to things until completed.&quot;</i></p>
          <p><i>&quot;He can sit and read for over an hour, it used to be 5 or 10 minutes.&quot;</i></p>
          <p><i>&quot;Although we have done many things to help our son with his overactive sensory motor system, the Interactive Metronome has given him the most usefull and measureable results.&quot; </i></p>
