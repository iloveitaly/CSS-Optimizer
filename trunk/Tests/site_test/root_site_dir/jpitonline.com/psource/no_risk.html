<p><b>You will have so many images to select for your main designer album/book!</b> We will photograph a lot of images up to hundreds of photographs. There is NO LIMIT TO THE AMOUNT OF EXPOSURES&mdash;limiting the number of images is the worst injustice a photographer can do when covering an <b><i>unfolding event.</i></b> Once the moment is vanished, its gone forever&mdash;limiting image production during any type of event, including weddings, is sure enough not practical, since special moments can be lost forever!</p>

We will include all the images taken during your special day; yes, that&rsquo;s right, all images taken...plus, you will receive the assembled imagealbum complete with hundreds of creations, at no extra cost to you.</b> There is ABSOLUTELY NO MINIMUM ORDERS.

<p class="header"><b>PROPER LIGHTING, EQUIPMENT AND TECHNIQUE</b></p>
<p>Working as a team, utilizing proper angles of the faces and the right lenses, knowing the cameras, knowing when to use fill flash or change the exposures, carrying an advanced light meter&mdash;some photographers will tell you that they have a light meter in their brains&mdash;be careful, lighting conditions change continuously&mdash;a fine photographer will tell you they have a handheld meter and advanced camera systems; <b>PROPER EXPOSURE</b> can make all the difference in the World. When the above is combined, you cannot help but to look great! Did you know the wrong lens could make you look 20 pounds heavier? </p>
<p class="header"><b>OUR EXCLUSIVE PERFORMANCE GUARANTEED!</b></p>
<p><b>I am forced to work a little harder than other studios to provide you with images you will be thrilled to own!</b> &mdash;Currently, photo studios will contract other photographers to photograph an event, pay them as little as possible, thus, profiting the most amounts of money (some include Video, DJ&rsquo;s and Photography) for a very ridiculous &ldquo;figure&rdquo;; however, when you see them at work, they are not professional photographers at all&mdash;some have full-time jobs, working as teachers, doctors, engineers, contractors, carpenters, garbage collectors, bus drivers, cookers during the week but are part-time &ldquo;mediocre imagetakers&rdquo; during weekends; several do not have proper knowledge of photography. I simply must do a great job with your images or you will not want them&mdash;then, I will be out of business since my reputation will go &ldquo;down the hill&rdquo;! I am a professional photographer at all times...my career is wedding/event photography...it is my life, my full time job!</p>
