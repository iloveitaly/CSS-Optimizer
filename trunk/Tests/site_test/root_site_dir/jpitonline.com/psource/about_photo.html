      <p>"I EXPECT TO PASS THROUGH THIS WORLD BUT ONCE. ANY GOOD THING, THEREFORE, THAT I CAN SHOW TO ANY FELLOW HUMAN BEING, LET ME DO IT NOW. LET ME NOT DEFER NOR NEGLECT IT, FOR I SHALL NOT PASS THIS WAY AGAIN." &ndash;william penn-</p>
      <p>"It has been said that a wedding is a special celebration that serves as a window to your individual style. The way you choose to celebrate can reveal your interests, beliefs, attitudes, and hopes. For some people, a wedding is solemn ritual or tender private moment: for most, however, it is a meaningful and memorable day filled with joyous commotion.</p>
      <p>Your wedding day is a distinctive special event that through the countless choices you make about the ceremony, the photographer, the video production, the reception, the fashion, the food, the flowers, and the music can make it uniquely your own.</p>
      <p>Naturally, the ceremony itself is the most important part of the event, although frequently it is the briefest. Wedding planning tends to focus on the various celebrations surrounding the service&mdash;rehearsal dinners, reception, or even breakfast the morning after the wedding. They require the most planning&mdash;and are the scenes of the most revelry. It may be hard to believe how busy you will be with the seemingly endless decisions, meetings, and phone calls to arrange the details of your wedding. Will it take place in a church or a home or a garden? Will it be during the day or in the evening? Will you have a religious ceremony? Who will participate with you? How many guests will attend? Will you carry an all-white cascade of roses and lilies or a colorful nosegay of freshly picked favorites? Will your cake be chocolate of lemon or carrot? Will you dance to jazz or rock or country/a band or a DJ?</p>
      <p>The key to all your wedding planning is organization: do a bit of reading, looking, comparing, and talk to your partner and family and friends about what is important to you. As the wedding approaches, try to complete each step on your list of preparations with calm and good humor. Remember that even if the minute-to-minute details of your wedding don't follow the course you've painstakingly set, there are very few mishaps that can mark the beauty of your special day."</p>

      <p>"Also, please remember that after everything is completed, the cake, the flowers, the music, the festivity...all will be gone&mdash;all you will remember, if it is well preserved are the recorded and appropriately saved images of your wedding day"-ness d&iacute;az valent&iacute;n-</p>
