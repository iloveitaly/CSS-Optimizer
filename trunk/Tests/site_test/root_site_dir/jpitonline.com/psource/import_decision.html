<p class="header">&ldquo;THE MOST IMPORTANT INVESTMENT YOU WILL EVER MAKE YOUR IMAGES&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>1)In my opinion, a specific style can only be developed through the photographer&rsquo;s personal touch</b>; his/her ability to interact with the people, thus, enabling an artist to create the most spectacular images.  By becoming engaged not only with the camera and the equipment but also with the entire day, beautiful images that express sensibility, grace and happiness are created.  Consequently, your day (JOURNEY/JORNADA) can be specially recorded&mdash;one of the reasons our organization was named:  ajourney/JOURNEYS PRESERVED IN TIME...</p>
<p><b>2)  Similarities will be found in the way other photojournalistic/documentary/traditional artistic photographers produce their images; however, my images are my own special creation.</b>  My attitude and approach are completely different than those used by others.  In my work, you will find clarity and purpose.  I utilize concepts used traditionally by many photographers and incorporate a &ldquo;story telling&rdquo; style of my own.</p>
<p><b>3)  Photography is an art of receptiveness&mdash;putting oneself in the way of the subject, recognizing it when it makes herself/himself available and grasping it out of the existing light in the click of an instant.</b>  This means countless hours and many photographs taken to capture unique images.<b></b></p>
<p><b>4)  Few photographers have worked the way I have.</b>  I portray the day as a pretty nice picturesque that you and the viewer can imagine.  The viewer will remember my unobtrusive style, my charismatic personality, and my technique, ability and talent while observing the images.  In addition to color photography, black and white and sepia tone images are taken to add variety, complexity and dimension to my work.</p>
<p><b>5)  I use special filters infrequently, and only on some occasions are subjects completely &ldquo;set up&rdquo; or obtrusively posed.</b>  Images for the most part are unaltered and not cropped.  The use of very advanced camera systems is used.  Several professional lenses are also utilized throughout the day.</p>
<p><b>6)  Photographs are arranged more or less chronologically.</b>  They date from the beginning until the completion of your day&rsquo;s journey.  Almost always our first photographic encounter occurs prior to the event&rsquo;s day; usually, during the engagement portrait designs where the couples are taken to a destination of their preference or one suggested by us: a college, a park, a beach.</p>
<p><b>7)  The selected group of images is translated into a series of photographic essays around the event&rsquo;s theme.</b>  The work selection and the album/book organization are central to understanding my intention for how my work should be viewed.  The images are supposed to be seen collectively; juxtapositions are entirely intentional.<b></b></p>
<p><b>8)  The wedding/event day is a JOURNEY/JORNADA full of nostalgia and affection, fragility and truth.</b>  I have spent most of my adult life learning concepts related photography.  I believe it is extremely important to seek the services of an experienced, knowledgeable professional photographer; one that can create images not to make an art, which is true for some photographers, but rather to find a photographer that is self-aware and has a more intimate knowledge of wedding/event concepts she/he knows and cares about deeply.  </p>
<p><b>9)  Becoming your friend is one of the first steps.</b>  As your photographer I am only a humble human being; a creator of images, no more or less than who you are.  You, the viewer will perceive me as being part of the real world, conveying a specific time and place.  My images will present the immediacy of my photographs, taking you to that special moment in time that many people saw but that you can only remembered and see, through <b>the creation of my photographs</b>.</p>
<p><b>10)  In my images, especially those that depict weddings and events, there is a range of feelings and emotions that seem true to the way people actually exist in the day.</b>  I look for images that strike my mind&rsquo;s eye.  Then I select some to discover if what I thought was there actually.  From the recollection of carefully selected images and the completion of an album/book, I bring objects, places, and people to life.</p>
<p><b>11)  Unlike, pictures from museums or paints from a painter&rsquo;s portfolio, where the viewer can control the sequence of looking, my images are to be read with images building and commenting on previous images.</b>  By &ldquo;capturing the moments&rdquo; the day is transformed into a motionless story; the viewer can almost feel a sense of &ldquo;being there&rdquo;.  At that moment imagination almost becomes reality.</p>
<p><b>12)  I recognize a particular point of view, a seamless narrative of time and tides.</b>  Your images will &ldquo;talk&rdquo; about <i>you</i>, <i>your beliefs, your traditions, </i><i>your friends, your family, the weather, the environment, the dresses, the jewelry, the decorations, the flowers</i>, all in all, the entire day.  Most of all, <b>I tell a story of the continuing vital relationship between work, nature, and the communal life of your day that exists for only moments; moments that quickly disappeared within a day.</b></p>
<p><b>13)  I recognize those special moments when viewed through my camera lens.</b>  The images will be recognizably beautiful to the eyes of the viewer and mine.  </p>
<p><b>14)  Beautiful is the JOURNEYS/JORNADAS, everyone involved in your special adventure, have traveled to take us to a moment I consider a special moment.</b>
In fact, I am as much part of the day as everyone else; without my enthusiasm, talent, and ability to capture your special day with my IMAGECREATIONS, only vague recollections of such an important life EVENT will exist&mdash;<b>&ldquo;an EVENT that will NEVER OCCUR, EVER AGAIN&rdquo;</b>.</p>
<p><b>15)  What I appreciate most is &ldquo;the ability to capture the spontaneous emotions and expressions of someone&rsquo;s wedding day and presenting them with images that will allow them to preserve those feelings through the magic of my CREATIONS.</b>  An opportunity to record their events will enable me to become the best person that I can be.  I want to utilize new techniques and expose new ideas to capture the &ldquo;events&rdquo; in people&rsquo;s life.  In 1996, I embarked in a career in photography and discovered my special niche in life <b>WEDDING/EVENT/PORTRAIT PHOTOGRAPHY</b>.  I started my photography career as an assistant event/wedding/portrait photographer, learning the basic and complex technical and traditional aspects of general photography as well as wedding photography.</p>
<p><b>16)  During the early stages of my career, in addition to quickly progressing from assistant to photographer, to director of photography, I learned several approaches to photographing Events/weddings: The photojournalistic/documentary/traditional/fine-art/adverticing/commercial or as I personally describe it; the &ldquo;PHOTONATURALISTIC&rdquo; approach.
I learned that utilizing my out-going, eager personality allows me to develop a rapport with the &ldquo;client&rdquo; which has helped me capture those &ldquo;special moments&rdquo;--I have been able to create a different style of my own.  I find that I value and take pride in memorializing people&rsquo;s biggest life events not only by being their photographer but also by becoming their friends.</b></p>
<p><b>17)  My artistic roots are not only found in photography alone&mdash;&ldquo;living this life is a process I call art.</b>
Since I majored in Philosophy, I received training in Ethics, Logic, and Aesthetics. This has enabled me to better understand the way we think, to better test our reasoning, and to best appreciate beauty.  The studies required for completing the Philosophy program, such as courses relating to the philosophy of religion, philosophy of history, and philosophy of science, helped me learn how to analyze the way we think and communicate.  By receiving a minor in Peace and Conflict Studies, I was able to learn how to examine social conflict, conflict resolution, and group communication on a national, as well as international level.  It also contributed to my understanding of peace with justice, various functions of conflict, and processes through which conflict can be managed.  Also, I have studied several photography courses at The New York Institute of Photography and completed several seminars offered by the Guild of Professional Photographers of Delaware Valley.</p>
<p><b>18)  My personal approval to devote my life in Photography is at the heart of my work and life in the United States.</b>  A person&rsquo;s dream is to be associated with educated, intelligent, responsible, effective, dedicated, honest, ethical and personable individuals.</p>
