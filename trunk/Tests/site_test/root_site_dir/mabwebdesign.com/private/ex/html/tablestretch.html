<!-- Allows the table to stretch 100% height; 
sometimes the DTD header screws the height up too;
Also use the top margin property to make the table stretch better
also you cannot have nested tables (maybe TD's, and TR's too) that have their height at 100% too
it will get messed up
also use margin: 0; to acomplish the same thing the leftmargin properties do.-->
