Each made huge improvements and first footsteps in various sciences and technologies.&nbsp; Each created incredible architectural wonders. Both made leaps in terms of governments, and politics. But, the argument that has swept over my little town is&nbsp; “Which is better? The Romans or the Greeks?” .&nbsp; The answer is not a simple one, but it is one that I think you will find most interesting.&nbsp; I will give a fair argument for both sides concentrating on the following main achievements of both civilizations:&nbsp; military development, government, architecture, simple machinery,&nbsp; peace keeping, and information distribution, </p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One person or one group of people didn’t start the Greek civilization. Greece was started by different groups of people who were hunters and gatherers moving off to another location when the resources ran out. Around 6000 B.C., the different groups of people decided to settle down in different parts of modern day Greece.&nbsp; These settlements may not sound like a big deal to you, but back then that was a big deal. Not many people actually settled down and started an organized “civilization”. The Greeks were pioneers in this area. So, in a gap of 3000 years they learned how to farm many different types of food, and to raise some different kinds of animals. Through communicating with other civilizations, the Greeks learned how to make simple pottery and baskets. At about 3000 B.C. the rate of progress increased, beginning the Bronze Age.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the course of the Bronze Age, there were two great cities/civilizations. The first was on the island of Crete, and was called the Minion civilization. It was a very rich civilization with pottery, palaces, paintings, and a form of writing. By about 1450 B.C. the civilization started to fall apart, and, shortly after, the Mycenaean’s, the second great civilization of the Bronze Age, conquered them.&nbsp; The Mycenaean’s are the first people that we would classify as Greek. Their civilization really started to prosper around 1600 B.C. and lasted till about 1200B.C. when it was taken over by another Greek civilization- the Dorian’s. There were two great achievements during the Bronze Age (1600B.C.-1200B.C.). The first achievement was the reason we call it the Bronze Age: they discovered bronze!! By accident metalworkers in Syria discovered that if they added tin to copper ore it would make metal stronger. The second wasn’t discovered by accident- how to melt iron. Greek metalworkers just could not get their fires hot enough&nbsp; to melt the iron.&nbsp; They found after they had piled the metal ore in the furnace it would mix with the cinders and ash.&nbsp; If they heated&nbsp; the ash again,&nbsp;&nbsp; hammered it repeatedly and let the mixture cool slowly, it eventually produced iron. Though they achieved some&nbsp; great things in the time span of the Bronze Age, the years to follow would not be as fruitful.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the next 400 years (1200B.C- 800B.C.), everything that the ancient world had discovered was set aside. For 400 years Greece had very little contact with the outside world. Learning had been pushed aside, fancy metalworking was cast aside in favor of simple pots, all knowledge of writing was lost – these years where called the Dark Ages. Although through the Dark Ages most knowledge of the previous civilizations was lost, other things were accomplished. Before the dark ages most people spoke different languages, but now all the Greek people spoke, well- Greek!&nbsp; A new government, a city-state where everybody had his/her own duties, replaced the monarchy. By the end of the Dark Ages they made a form of writing adapted from the Phoenicians. By about 700 B.C the Dark Ages were over and the Greek people rose ready to make a new civilization!</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 700-500 B.C., much growth&nbsp; occurred. Greeks spread and settled throughout&nbsp; Greece. They left the mainland to find new places where they would settle. By settling, they talked with different people. The other more advanced people opened the Greeks minds to things that they had forgotten like metalworking, and other skills.&nbsp; They also set up trading routes with these other civilizations. For the next few&nbsp; years they switched governments : from kings to tyrants to oligarchies&nbsp; and finally to democracy. Although Greek people as a whole were all democratic, they were separate peoples none-the-less.&nbsp; Although they all thought of themselves as “Greek”, they each had loyalty to their own city-states and were not unified as one people. I believe, in the end , this is what destroyed their great civilization.&nbsp; Well, we might as well get started talking about what the Greeks accomplished since I have given you a good background on the civilizations that formed “Greece”. </p>  <h1 style='line-height:200%'><span style='text-shadow:none'><u>Government</u></span></h1>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Greeks had a government that was ahead of their time: democracy. It wasn’t democracy, as we know it today because not everyone had equal rights. Women and slaves had limited rights. They could not participate in Greek politics and could not take part in social life but could take part in the arts. Greek women were&nbsp; housewives concentrating on weaving and cooking. They weren’t held in high esteem by their husbands and were not frequently seen&nbsp; in public. Ironically, slaves made up most of the population in Greece so it is hard to understand why the government wouldn’t let them participate in “ Greek life.” But, even more ironic, the Greeks believed that any boy over the age of 18 should have a part in the government, even though the amount of slaves&nbsp; greatly outnumbered the amount of male citizens. </p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>The Greeks had a new idea that each person was an individual, that each person’s thought was worth as much as another’s- not just worth as much as his superior’s opinion.&nbsp; The Greek form of government was the basis upon which government of America was shaped.. But, the one thing that sets their form of government apart from our current form is that they were not united in one nation and they occasionally fought each other and spilled their own people’s blood. They also did not build roads very often. They found them time consuming . I also think another factor that went into the reasons they had no roads was because they had no empire. They had no “need” to communicate with the other part of the empire effectively because they were not united, “every man for himself” you would say.&nbsp; But, the Greeks also came up with a very effective way of relaying a message over long distances. They had little stations on high hills lined up in such a way that if there was a fire&nbsp; lit on&nbsp; one of the hills, the people on the other hill would be able to see it, then the people on the second hill would light their fire and eventually, the “fire chain” would get to the other destination. The only problem with this system is that you could only give one answer “yes”, or ‘no”. So, the Greeks came with a better (?) way. The people on each of the hills/mountains would have torches and bottles of the same size, with the same amount of water in each of the bottles. The bottles would have a cork on the bottom holding the water in. Floating on top of the water, there was a cork with a stick (again the stick and cork were all sized the same). The bottles would be lined with marks at certain intervals, so that each mark meant a different message. When they needed to send a message, the person on the first hill would hold up their torch. When the person on the second hill held up his torch, the person on the first hill lowered his torch and pulled the cork out from underneath the bottle. The water poured out of the bottle and the stick and the cork sunk down respectively. When the stick went down enough and lined up with the appropriate line on the bottle which represented the message he wanted to send,, the person on the first hill held up his torch, which meant “ put the cork in the bottle”.&nbsp;&nbsp; The person&nbsp; on the second hill would check the water level on his bottle&nbsp; with the corresponding message for that particular water level.&nbsp; Pretty creative, huh? The Greeks also were very effective in communicating ideas with others. They set up trade routes with other countries. By setting up an extensive amount of trade routes they were able to expand their knowledge because, naturally, when they went to the foreign countries to do business, conversation would lead to an exchange of ideas.</p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>Religion</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Religion was the center of Greek life. The Olympic games honored Zeus, and if they had a question about something they went to the oracle. Everything they did was “for the gods”. You’re probably wondering what an oracle is .. In Greece, there was a special temple where a special person was who&nbsp; the Greeks believed, had a connection with the gods. They called this person an oracle. Whenever the Greeks had a problem they went to the oracle for an answer, because ultimately, the Greeks believed, the oracle “spoke for the gods”. </p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>The Greeks believed in divination. Divination is when you can predict the future. They believed the oracle could do this that’s why they came to her/him with all their questions. Did the oracle tell the future or just outline a predictable outcome ? For example when a commander of a Greek army came to the oracle and asked, “What if the enemy attacks?” The oracle would say something like, “One of the armies will die.” – an outcome predictable by anyone. I find it disappointing that they Greeks believed such superstition. </p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Ah, yes the Olympic games- a form of entertainment but more importantly a performance for the gods! The Greeks every year had the Olympic games near/on Mt. Olympus where the gods supposedly lived. The Olympic game honored the god Zeus.&nbsp; They also dedicated all/most of buildings they made to the gods. As you may have noticed the Greeks were very religious, I would go to say that it was one of the most religious civilizations that ever lived. The only problem is that they were practicing polytheism, but that’s not their fault. Whether or not the Greeks would have converted to Catholicism if Jesus were alive in their time is an unanswerable question.&nbsp; Even though the Greeks were worshipping false gods it did give they them&nbsp; some morals,&nbsp; more morals than other civilizations of that time.</p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>Art </h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;Greeks were incredible artists. They weren’t first in the art field, but they were the first to really come up with modern ideas of painting and use of pottery. They also used leather to make shoes, sandals, and all sorts of clothing and other items. We actually still use leather to make clothing&nbsp; and other items today. The Greeks made paint from&nbsp; natural pigments&nbsp; including roots, leaves, and mineral ores. They even mixed different paints to create different colors. The Greeks also made dyes by soaking various plants in hot water. They then came up with a way to dye cloth with the dyes. The accomplishment in the painting field that I think is the most amazing is that they made the first paint that wouldn’t smear. It was an incredible accomplishment. It allowed them to paint statues and decorate the outside of their homes and gardens.&nbsp; They made this special paint by mixing the paint pigments with beeswax and resin, then the mixture was put in a bronze pot that was continually heated so it kept the mixture hot and runny. While the paint was hot, they would paint it onto the surface. The Greeks also developed a way to paint on pots. They would paint with black and white. Then when they heated the painted pot in the kiln, the white would turn black and the black would turn red. So in the end you would have a black on red mosaic. The Greeks were incredible artists; they developed techniques that were amazing for their time.</p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>Architectural</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Greeks were incredible at building structures. The most amazing thing that I think they did was make buildings without mortar. That is one thing that I don’t think builders today could go without. You might be puzzled about how the structures stayed together without mortar. There were two ideas that the Greeks incorporated that allowed the buildings/structures to stay together without mortar. First, they used little metal “rivets”. They were very small, looked like staples and were inserted into a little hole located in the middle edge of each stone that the masons made. Since each stone had&nbsp; a hole, the rivets fit into each stone like pieces of a puzzle. The second way is pretty obvious: weight. Marble stone/slabs are so heavy that weight alone allowed them to hold together. Since the marble was so heavy they needed a way to get the marble to its destination. They used oxen to transport marble across land since it was the strongest animal they could find.&nbsp; Alas it was slow. When the marble got close to the building site, they used a crane&nbsp; to lift the blocks into the proper place. </p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Although the Greeks also wanted to make buildings pleasing to the eye, they didn’t want them to look curved or crooked. A great example is the Parthenon. The Parthenon was built between 447-438 B.C. in the Periclian Age. The Parthenon was built using stone pillars to support it. The stone pillars had lines engraved in them Structurally, this was fine, except that the lines looked curved and this displeased the Greeks.&nbsp; To fix this they actually&nbsp; counter -curved the lines a certain amount to make them look like they were straight. Again appealing to the eye, they sculpted stone into pillars for buildings, and they even had many sculptors inside the Parthenon. </p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>The Greeks were not very fond of roads. They were made very sparingly. When the Greeks did choose to make roads, they made them by putting flat stones in the ground, but more impressively they made grooves for wagon wheels to fit into. So yes,&nbsp; only people riding wagons&nbsp; mainly used roads. This was a poor choice because this eliminated the chance for Greeks to be able to establish trade routes, and communicate in a faster more efficient way. </p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>The Greeks also came up with an idea of aqueducts. Aqueducts were used as a plumbing system for the ancient world. They channeled water through stone built waterways. The most amazing thing about their waterways was that they went straight through the mountains. “Through the mountains?” you might say, “Wouldn’t it be easier to go through the mountains than to go around them?” Well, yes, it would be less work, but at the same time more expensive because you had to transport and use more stone,&nbsp; It also allowed enemies easier access to it especially if it was near the shore (which was where the mountains and the aqueducts met). To build an aqueduct&nbsp; through the mountains they made shafts that went from the top of the mountains&nbsp; down&nbsp; to the aqueduct that was going through the mountains. These shafts helped the water flow more easily because it allowed air to get in and out of the underground aqueduct. The water then flowed from the aqueducts to the city reservoirs where people in the city would use it. Even though the Greeks had a way to transport water over a great distance, they didn’t take this technology one step further and make it available to the public. There was no running water; in addition there was no soap. When you went to take a bath you rubbed yourself with olive oil and then scrubbed yourself down with a hard brush. Even though the Greeks thought of transporting water to the baths, they didn’t have sewer systems. To get rid of trash they just threw it in the streets and forgot about it. This allowed for a free spread of disease because of the rapid growth of rats or similar disease carrying animals. The use of aqueducts was a great accomplishment for Greece, but it’s disappointing that they didn’t take it one step further and create sewer systems.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>There is one more structure that the Greeks were exceptionally good at building- the theater. They made, arguably the best theater this world has ever seen.&nbsp; It was made of solid stone and its acoustics are perfect so that sounds could be heard in any place you were sitting. It was great for plays back then and still is today. The theater at Epidaurus could hold 14,000 people.&nbsp; The Greeks still use it for annual plays to this very day. </p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Another achievement the Greeks made in architecture was making three new styles of columns. They called them Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. Each one had a different level of complexity. Overall the Greeks were very good architects, but failed to apply their vast knowledge to more useful things to enhance their empire.</p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>Entertainment</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>The Greeks had many forms of entertainment. One of the more popular forms of entertainment was the theater. Greeks had a good idea about keeping the peace with their city states: keep the people entertained. Actually, they made it mandatory that you go to the theaters, and if you were too poor&nbsp; to afford it, then the state would pay for you. The Greeks also created the first form of the Olympics. They played many games included boxing, the long jump, chariot races, and a few more. Greeks were the first civilization to use sports equipment. Even though the all these elements made the Olympic games a great event, the best part of it is that ALL of Greece participated in the Olympic games. Every providence, every city state; they all came together for the Olympic games. This is the <i>only </i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'>event where Greece could really be called a united nation.</span></p>  <h3>Great People of Greece</h3>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Greece as a nation, in my opinion, didn’t accomplish too much. It was singular Greek citizens who should be credited with the accomplishments of&nbsp; Ancient Greece. Here are a few of them:</p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>Archimedes</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Archimedes was an incredible inventor and mathematician. He invented the first pump. It looked like a screw. It could pump water from a lower area to a higher area. This may sound like a simple thing to you now, but 2,000+ years ago this was big. Before that they had to use buckets and carry the water by hand. The screw allowed them to transport water without much manpower. This is one&nbsp; of the&nbsp; things the Greeks tried to do- make simple machines to make whatever job they were doing easier. Archimedes also made lots of military weapons. The coolest thing he made&nbsp; was a crane that picked up the roman ships and capsized them. He also made a cross bow that could shoot over 850 feet. In addition to those war weapons, he also made a very crude version of a catapult.</p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>Socrates</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Socrates was a great philosopher who went in search of the truth. He was the first one to come up with the idea of one god. He inquired about how things worked, he questioned the world.&nbsp; He stimulated people to ask themselves about how the world worked.<b><u></u></b></p>  <h4>Aristotle</h4>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Aristotle was a philosopher like Socrates but gave people knowledge instead asking them about their own ideas. He came up with his own ideas and spread them around Greece. Aristotle also wrote a book on how to use simple machine.</p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>Hippocrates</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Hippocrates was a great pioneer of medicine. He is aptly called the “father” of medicine. He thought constantly about disease and sickness. Instead explaining disease in terms of&nbsp; religious superstition , he used logic. He pondered the statistics: If “x” amount of people came into his room with “y” sickness and each of those people had a common “h” characteristic, then the disease mighty very well be caused by that “h” characteristic. This sounds like very simple thinking today, but back then when&nbsp; the cause of sickness was thought to be some “act of the god’s” . Hippocrates proposals were revolutionary. </p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Hippocrates also made the first chiropractic table, it could reset dislocated bones. Hippocrates believed that the body was a mixture of a 4 elements: phlegm, black bile, yellow bile, and blood. He believed that someone would get sick if there was an in balance of the 4 elements. He was partly right.&nbsp; Disease is caused by the imbalance of chemicals/elements in the body. Hippocrates just got the elements wrong. Hippocrates also came with the idea (wacky?) of bleeding. Since (in his mind) sickness was an imbalance of the 3 elements, to cure a disease you need to adjust the levels of the 4 elements to restore balance to the body. He decided the best way to do this was to cut a person open and let their blood pour out. As crazy as it seems this method was used for years and years afterwards. </p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>Philip of Macedonia &amp; Alexander the Great</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Philip was an incredible military commander but, as a Macedonian, he was a foreigner to Greece. He wanted to unite Greece but,&nbsp; a political route would be unsuccessful since the&nbsp; Greeks were too proud of their individual city states to surrender their independence for the sake of unification .&nbsp; So Philip of Macedonia chose a military route towards unification, gathering up an army and challenging each Greek city state. He conquered city-state after city-state until, well, he died. Then his son, named “Alexander the Great”, finished the job. He finished conquering Greece and won many decisive battles. So, after “Alexander the Great” and his father finished conquering all of Greece, “Greece” was finally united. Now “Greece” was at its golden age. Alexander made the new capital of Greece “Alexandria”, and scholars and scientists from all over flocked to go there. It was the height of Greek civilization.&nbsp; However, this unified Greek civilization only lasted 300 years.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>You are probably thinking now, “Wow, so Greece did finally unite!”&nbsp; It really matters how you look at unite. Alexander and his father had to <i>re-conquer all of Greece </i><span style='font-style:normal'>before it could be united. They could of re-conquered&nbsp; it and called it something else but they just left the name “Greece” . So, to make Greece whole&nbsp; Alexander needed to kill the Greek people themselves. So, did Greece really unite by themselves? The answer is no, Greece needed a leader from a foreign country, Macedonia, to conquer&nbsp; it first.</span></p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>Military</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>The Greeks had a very impressive military with two divisions: the army and the navy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the city states needed&nbsp; an army they called on the peasants to fight. The peasants who had money and could afford armor were called hoplites.&nbsp; Hoplites were heavily armored men-at-arms. They wore leg guards, bronze helmets, bronze shields, shoulder protection, and waist protection. Hoplites fought by making a human wall of themselves while running&nbsp; and stabbing with their spears. When the line&nbsp; of hoplites broke, they used hand to hand combat. When the city states called upon the citizens it was probably the equivalent of drafting today, except they volunteered. Greeks had an extreme sense of loyalty, only not to Greece, but to their own city states. There were many wars between the many city states, and the city states would often not help another city state that was being attacked by a foreign country. Again, there lack of unification hindered their greatness. It eventually was the cause of their downfall. <b><u></u></b></p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>The incredible Greeks Navy was really their strong point. There were two types of Greek boats: longboats and round ships. The round ships were mostly used for merchant work, and trading.&nbsp; The long boat was used as an army boat. The long boat&nbsp; was good, but not great. The Greeks really made the longboat an incredible warship by making it a battering ram on the water. They did this by adding a bronze “cap” to the front of the boat. This allowed the boat to ram into an enemy’s boat, cutting the enemy boat in half. There was one problem, it didn’t have enough speed. The Greeks needed more speed without altering the main design of the ship too much and without adding more levels/a lot more weight. They did this by adding more people in rows that were diagonal. This allowed triple the amount of people without tripling the weight. If they ‘d made the places for the rowers to sit in different levels like stories in a house, then the boat would capsize. The process of making the boat was pretty complex too. It involved mortise and tendon joints, using pitch and beeswax to prevent leaks, wood curving, and many advanced woodworking techniques.</p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>Romans</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earliest records indicate that the Etruscans founded Rome in 753 B.C.. The Etruscans were mysterious people who appeared in Italy around 800 B.C. For the next 250 years seven kings reigned it. The last of the kings was very arrogant causing the people to rebel, expelling the idea of monarchy&nbsp; and the power of the Etruscans out of Rome forever .&nbsp; Following this Roman rebellion, the richest families rose to Roman rule. The common people did not like this., and eventually they were able to elect certain people to represent them in the government. These ‘representatives’ agreed upon and made the ‘twelve tables”, a set of laws much like the amendments in our government.</p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>Military</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Roman army developed to be one of the best armies of the ancient world. Initially, the Roman army consisted of volunteers from the Rome. The roman army’s initial purpose was to defend Rome! Eventually Roman general recruited the roman army, paid the army soldiers, and trained them. When soldiers enlisted in the army, they usually stayed in for 20-25 years. When the Roman army conquered a land, the soldiers in that legion got a share of the loot. Sometimes the soldiers were rewarded with property in the conquered land. </p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>A roman legion was made up of 4,800 men who were divided into many different sections. What made this massive army force so incredible was the way they worked together, they worked ‘as one’. They thought of themselves as ‘Rome’ and not as, ‘legion x’.&nbsp; A great example of this is some of the military tactics they used. A popular one was the tortoise technique. It involved a box of soldiers who held up their shields in such a way so that everybody in the box was protected in all directions. To keep the soldiers from tiring easily that often ‘rotated’ the front line. They made it so the soldiers fighting in the front lines would rotate with the soldiers behind resting the battle worn soldiers thus reducing casualties.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;Another tactic they often used to take towns is&nbsp; to siege. They would surround the town with army, and have artillery aimed at it, and prevent any supplies from getting in or out. If this would take too long ,they would construct siege towers to allow them to easily enter the city. There was also many&nbsp; siege weapons that the Romans used.&nbsp; An onager was one of them. It pulled back a large strap allowing many small rocks&nbsp; to be fired toward the enemy lines. Another weapon they used was a scorpion. It fired a large arrow by pulling a strap back and firing- it was the equivalent of the crossbow in the middle ages. But, the catapult is the most famous of the four. They used a large spring that was pulled back and released a large rock into the enemy lines. The projectiles used were not just limited to rocks. They used flaming balls of pitch, and a variety of harmful huge objects.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>When the Romans conquered a land they didn’t just take it over and go on to the next land.; they&nbsp; assimilated&nbsp; the conquered culture into theirs. They actually had military men settle in the conquered country, intermarry, and spread roman ideas. By doing this they reduced the chance of a revolt against Rome because they <i>were </i><span style='font-style:normal'>Rome. They didn’t take away their old lives they just gave them new, better ones. For instance Rome build bathes, aqueducts and many other popular roman structures for the people to enjoy.&nbsp; In addition to giving ideas to the newly conquered people, they took ideas too. For instance, when they conquered Spain, they conquered it mainly because of the intellectual value of it. They took from the Spaniards the idea of sandals, the idea of the two edged sword, and many techniques of metal workings. They gave all conquered people common roots to bond with. </span></p>  <h2 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:200%'>Government</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>After Rome rebelled against the last of the seven kings (509B.C.), Rome became a republic.&nbsp; Two consuls, elected each year by the senate, governed the roman republic. The senate was made up of the aristocratic (rich, or well known) families. Eventually, the Plebeians revolted and made it so the senators were elected. In addition to senators, there were governors who oversaw the smaller providences. The senate also elected the governors. This worked for a while until Julius Caesar cam into power.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Julius Caesar got rid of his rivals in the government and then seized power as a dictator. Julius Caesar even introduced the ‘Julian calendar’ in 46 B.C.. Our yearly calendar is nearly identical to the one Julius Caesar invented. He was eventually murdered because the senators did not want a dictator. So they elected Octavian in 27B.C. Even after the fall of Julius Caesar, there will still evil men who wanted to have a lot of power and put Rome into there own hands. Or they were unfair and stole from the people in subtle way. This led to even more rebellions.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Octavian was the Julius Caesar’s son. He wasn’t power hungry and instead of acting like a dictator he established himself as an emperor. His interests were for the better of Rome, not for the better of himself. When he was elected he immediately started to reform Roman government. Everything from taxation, to the army, to building new cities- Octavian changed it for the better. For the next 500 years Rome would be called the Romans EMPIRE. This&nbsp; unification is what made Rome so successful, they established themselves as one empire, not a collection of divided city states.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Rome there were two types of people: citizens and slaves. Similar to the Greeks, slaves ( non-citizens and women ) were not allowed to hold public office or to have a say in the government. They were mostly housewives like the Greek women. But, unlike the Greeks, their husbands held them in high honor. Both boys and girls went to the same school until they were teenagers. When they where teenagers, they went off to learn about different subjects that would help them in life. </p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Roman clothes were very simple. White was the only acceptable color for clothing. Their clothes were little more then robes that covered their whole body. The privilege of wearing purple was reserved for &quot;special&quot; people.&nbsp; Romans were very practical, everything they did was practical. Their clothes were practical, the art was practical.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;Even though slaves had no civil rights, they could buy them or gain them. In Rome&nbsp; it&nbsp; was very common for slaves to be set free. They could save up enough money to ‘buy’ themselves, or if the family really liked them they would be set free. But, even when they were set free, they often kept working for the same masters, just being paid full wages.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Romans constructed their towns in blocks, similar to our&nbsp; arrangement of towns today. In the center of all the blocks of buildings there was a market or a forum where people could buy stuff and gossip about current events. Also in the middle was a shrine to the gods, and a town-hall like building. A sacred plough marked the boundaries of the town, and often guard towers and army buildings were erected along the city walls.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The living conditions between the rich and poor differed greatly. Rich peoples houses were often decorated with beautiful mosaics. They were lit up with many lamps, and were served by many servants. The wealthy people of Rome had elaborate houses that consisted&nbsp; of a shrine for the gods, a shop were people could buy items, a feasting area, baths, and a very nicely laid out interior with many rooms. The poor on the other hand lived in apartment type buildings. On the bottom of this apartment type building called insulae were shops. The rest of the levels of the building where living quarters. The insulaes had no stoves, and no running water. Because there were no stoves there were many fires because of people trying to cook on make-shift stoves. Emperor Augustus tried to remedy this by creating a fire service that consisted of 1,000 men and was called the vigilies. Rich or poor, everyone stopped for lunch at noon. After their lunch everyone took a small break called a siesta.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roman currency (coins) were introduced in 280 B.C. and where originally produced to ease the payment of soldiers’ salaries and facilitate payment of taxes. But coins eventually evolved to shaping the economic system of the Romans. It even eventually led to the practice of money lending.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romans were very involved in trade. They developed trade routes along their roads, but more importantly on the sea. Trade routes on the roads worked well for small items and small amounts of goods.&nbsp; Because of the inefficiency of roads for transporting large amounts of goods, the Romans used boats as their primary trade avenue. Boats were more practical for Romans because they OWNED the whole Mediterranean Sea. They didn’t have to worry about pirates, or any other countries trying to destroy or capture their boats because they were the only country. </p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romans all spoke one language- Latin. Latin was spoken throughout Europe during the Roman Empire. And after the roman civilization collapsed, it was used as the base for most of the modern languages in Europe. Actually, many sciences use Latin words as the base for naming scientific items. The reason science uses Latin is because it is an unchanging language unlike ours where ‘cool’ can mean something different a century later then it did in the past. For this reason the Catholic Church chose Latin as its primary language for many centuries</p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>Art</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Romans developed new techniques in art that were rediscovered and utilized during the greatest artistic era, the Renaissance. Even though roman art was very beautiful, it was also practical. For example, Romans did not try to paint portraits to make the person look better than they really are. They painted the portrait to show what the person really looked like no matter how ugly or pretty he/she was. The Romans mainly used marble to do their artwork, although they sometimes used bronze. The most popular form of painting was a mural. The Romans also made mosaics. They were experts at designing them as they also doubled up as a floor.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romans where also pioneers in the glass industry. They were the first ones who devised a method for&nbsp; glass blowing. This allowed glass to become vastly cheaper and allowed for poor people to buy it. During the Greeks time glass was so expensive that only the richest&nbsp; could afford it.</p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>Architectural</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Rome was a nation of incredible architecture. When they built a building they&nbsp; built it not only to be useful but to be aesthetically pleasing as well.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One or the great inventions the Romans made was the idea of a central heating system. It was called the hypocaust heating system. Buildings were specially built with spaces between there inner and outer walls and beneath the floors. A fire was lit and the heat traveled through the spaces in the walls thus heating the house.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The architectural achievement that the Romans are most famous for is the creation of roads. By 200 A.D.&nbsp; The Romans had build 53,000 miles of roads. The Romans use of roads allowed their empire to communicate, expand, and be more stable. Roman roads were used for trade routes, to relay messages quickly across the empire, and to transport the army across the empire- among the more important uses. They were built with three layers to ensure longevity. Before making the roads, roman engineers made sure the layout for the roads was strait with a special tool called a groma. The first layer was composed of stone slabs in cement; this layer was resting on sand. The second layer was composed of crushed stone in cement, and the layer after that was flat stone slabs- this was the layer that people used. The blocks of stone were held in by curbs and there was even ditches on the side of the curbs for the water to drain into! Roads were one of the greatest architectural achievements by the Romans; it opened up various trade routes and allowed people to exchange ideas with each faster than ever before. But the most amazing part of roman roads is that they are still in use today.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most important architectural achievements that the Romans made was the invention of the arch. Arches could hold an immense amount of weight and was used in such buildings as the coliseum, and utilized in structures such as aqueducts.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Romans, like the Greeks had aqueducts. They build the large aqueducts similar to the way the Greeks did except that they used arches to strengthen the structure. The Romans like the Greeks used the aqueducts to carry fresh water into he city for use. The difference is the Romans applied this technology where the Greeks didn’t. They used aqueducts to bring sewage and drain water away from the city.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another great architectural achievement of the Romans was accomplished during the emperors Hadrian’s rule. Under his rule he stopped all the fighting and conquering that was waged by previous emperors and decided to reinforce the borders that they had conquered. The most famous thing he built was the Hadrian wall that stretched over 75 miles across northern England from shore-line to shore-line.</p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>Entertainment</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>In Rome there were three types of entertainment. Plays, gladiator fights, and chariot races. The most popular of the three was by far the gladiator fights. Gladiator fights where when two men, or a man and an animal fought each other to the death. The majority of participants were criminals or slaves. Just like Greece, the Roman government paid for all the people to go and see these shows.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chariot races where a lot like our horse races today. They consisted of four teams, the red, blue, green, and the white. People supported their own team with great passion like we do for many sports today. They even bet money on there favorite horses. The most famous of the racetracks was the Circus Maximums. It held 250,000 people and was 600 yards long.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Theater was another type of entertainment the Romans participated in. Males played all the parts in the plays and used masques to depict their mood.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baths were another form of entertainment. They were a place where everybody went to talk socialize and relax. There were many different sections in the baths including cold, hot, and dry or humid- they were all vaulted off to keep the designated temperature. Women usually went to baths in the morning and the men usually went in the afternoon. The baths just didn’t have baths in them. Right outside the baths there were sports areas where people could weight train, play ball sports. Baths varied in size and grandeur depending on the location. The baths of Diocletian covered over 5 acres! Some baths were very small and only had room for a group of people at a time.</p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>Religion</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>The Romans worshipped many gods and spirits, as did the Greeks. Actually, many of the gods that the Romans worshipped were Greek gods with different names. As with the Greeks, large temples where erected to honor the Roman gods. Festivals were made to honor the gods and usually involved a chariot race or entertainment of some sort.&nbsp; During these festivals nobody worked. Offerings of animals were also given to the gods. The Romans also foolishly believed in the practice of divination. When they sacrificed the animals, the priests took out the animals’ innards to read the gods intentions. </p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Romans were not a strict about religion as the Greeks. They let you practice any religion you wanted as long as you paid homage to the Roman gods. Romans are often portrayed as torturing Christians and Jews, which they did, but not without purpose. The Christian and the Jewish religions&nbsp; forbade the worship other gods. So&nbsp; the Christian and Jewish refusal to worship Roman gods was a denial of Roman authority, which&nbsp; Romans interpreted as an opportunity for the empire to fall. The Christians also worshiped in secret, which also led the Romans to believe that they were hiding something. So, yes, what the Romans did was wrong- but it was not without logical reason, the preservation of Rome.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'><b><u>Medicine</u></b><spanstyle='font-weight:normal'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>The Romans were not much more advanced than the Greeks in medicine. The only people who could afford doctors were the very rich. Even the very rich might have had trouble finding doctors because of the lack of them- there where very few doctors in Rome. Although doctors were scarce, the few who existed were very skilled in using advanced medical techniques to treat patients.</p>  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>The Conclusion</h2>  <p style='line-height:200%'>So&nbsp; which civilization was better?</p>  <p align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:200%'>Military</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Greek military , high tech for its time, had armor and siege weapons like the Romans. The Roman weapons and armor however, were&nbsp; more advanced, improving on the weapons and armor originating in Greece. The Romans were unbeatable with their&nbsp; advanced military tactics.&nbsp; They developed&nbsp; strong morale for their troops functioned as ‘one’. Their military techniques and advanced weaponry decreased fatigue and increased safety and effectiveness.&nbsp; In addition to advanced techniques and technology, their army was the world’s largest.&nbsp; Unlike the divided Greek city states, the united Roman Empire increased availability of men to enlist as soldiers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The big downside of the Greek military was that they were not united.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Greek city states were constantly fighting each other to decide who was the “best” so they never were never as powerful or as organized as the Romans.&nbsp; There is no question… the Roman military wins hands down.</p>  <h1 style='line-height:200%'><span style='text-shadow:none'>Science and Technology</span></h1>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Greeks win in this category&nbsp; forming stepping-stones in almost all aspects of science, medicine, architecture, metalworking and woodworking, simple machines, art, philosophy, and astrology.&nbsp; The Romans just improved on Greek principles, never really discovering much on their own.</p>  <h1 style='line-height:200%'><span style='text-shadow:none'>Government and Peace Keeping</span></h1>  <p style='line-height:200%'>The Greeks and the Romans are very close in this section, but in my opinion the Romans won. The Romans maintained peace in the largest geographical area for the longest time in recorded history. This is controversial because the Romans&nbsp; used gruesome entertainment, the gladiators, to keep peace.&nbsp; Although the gladiators were very violent, and were very immoral, there are a few misconceptions of the gladiators that I would like to settle.&nbsp; The gladiators were&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>NOT </b><spanstyle='font-weight:normal'>innocent people thrown into the arenas to fight. This is </span><b>NOT </b><span style='font-weight:normal'>true. Gladiators were paid men, convicted criminals, or occasionally slaves or prisoners of war.&nbsp; Their masters gave gladiator slaves to the arena.&nbsp;&nbsp; To ensure that the owners didn’t give away his slave for an indecent reason, Rome established laws, which allowed only slaves who had committed a criminal act to be given to the arena. The paid men where usually once free citizens who had financial difficulties. Even though the gladiator’s job was immoral, they got decent benefits, 3 free meals a day, free medical care, and free ‘lodging’. As you can see, the gladiator position was self-inflicted.&nbsp; Gladiator fights were not the only method of peace keeping system in the Rome; laws, chariot races, religious ceremonies, theater plays, and armed forces also helped keep the peace. The Romans did kill a lot of people in the process of keeping the peace, but so did the Greeks just in a different way. The conflicts between city states over supremacy resulted in a massive loss of life, massive enough I would venture to say to equal the amount of people the Romans killed. So the Greeks&nbsp; ‘kept the peace’ by fighting wars against its neighbors, and the Romans ‘kept the peace’ by fighting in the coliseum. </span></p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>Persecution of the Catholics is another issue that surrounds the gladiators and the arena.&nbsp; Although the Romans where very cruel and immoral&nbsp; to the Catholics, a comparison can not be made between the Romans and the Greeks on the counter culture of Christianity because Jesus wasn’t around in the time of Greece. Knowing that the Greeks devotion to their religion was much more serious than the Romans, we can only ponder that the Greek’s reaction may have been more severe.</p>  <p style='line-height:200%'>In conclusion, Rome was superior to Greece mainly because of the unity of Rome. The unity of Rome allowed them to do things as a team, as a group- not one verse another. Through such unification,&nbsp; they could accomplish goals that Greece could not. They kept peace throughout the greatest amount of territory on record to this day. They brought many different cultures together with an increased ability to share progressive ideas through a common language.&nbsp; They owned the whole Mediterranean Sea, and&nbsp; had the most extensive roadways in the ancient world, which allowed exchange of information, military transportation, and fast communication between government officials, educators, scientists and city planners.&nbsp; For these accomplishments, Rome is the best Ancient Civilization.</p>  <h5>ROMANS VS.
