            <p>FLICKERING CANDLELIGHT DANCES OFF A SILVER BOWL AND CATCHES THE WARM TONES OF GINGER, APRICOT AND AUBURN ROSES IN A STRIKING CENTERPIECE. A STATELY TOWER OF WHITE CHOCOLATE CURLS AND SUGARED VIOLETS PROVIDES A FINISHING TOUCH ATOP A RASPBERRY-FILLED CHOCOLATE CAKE COVERED IN IVORY BUTTER CREAM FROSTING. THE BEADS AND SEED PEARLS IN A HEADPIECE PEEK OUT FROM A BRIDE&rsquo;S CHIGNON, ECHOING THE DELICATE EMBELLISHMENTS THAT ADORN HER GOWN.</p>
            <p>Weddings are among life&rsquo;s grandest occasions, yet it is often the smallest details that have the most powerful impact. The trim on a gown, the blooms selected for a centerpiece; the ribbon used to bind a bridesmaid&rsquo;s bouquet; the fillings. Frosting and edible decorations of a cake; and the headpiece that crowns a bride&rsquo;s ensemble all attribute to the pervading mood and style of the event. These elements can set a traditional tone, make a contemporary statement, or simply convey a sense of romance befitting the day.</p>
            <p>What&rsquo;s more, these touches can be a form of personal expression, reflecting the bride&rsquo;s and groom&rsquo;s tastes and style. Indeed, inventive flourishes provide a wonderful way for a couple to put their own unique stamp on the celebration. Sources of inspiration are endless. Aside from favorite colors and styles, a couple can weave elements representative of a cherished vacation spot, a meaningful historical era, or a shared hobby throughout the ceremony and reception. Many take their cues from the setting of the wedding or the season&mdash;a centerpiece of shells and sand for seaside festivities, a bouquet featuring holly for a wedding at Christmastime, a cake covered in marzipan fruits suggesting the bounty of the harvest for an autumn affair. The effort you put into such thoughtful touches will not only be appreciated on the big day, but also inject a dash of fun and whimsy into your planning process. </p>
