		    <h2 align="center">Classes Are Availible For </h2>
		    <p>Students ranging from pre-kindergarten to adults. Pre-writing instruction is available for children as young as 4-1/2. Older students receive instruction in printing or cursive writing, according to their age and need. Whether seen privately or in a small group, instruction is individualized to each student's skill level and pace. In small group instruction children are grouped with peers.</p>
		    <h2 align="center">About the Staff </h2>
		    <p><b><u>Amy Carroll, OTR/L</u></b> is the occupational therapist/owner of <i>Handwriting Success</i>, Inc.&nbsp; She is&nbsp;the instructor&nbsp;for every private, small group, or camp class that is offered by <i>Handwriting Success</i>!&nbsp; Amy has 19 years of experience working with children with occupational therapy needs and more specifically with handwriting challenges.&nbsp; She&nbsp; has worked in&nbsp; both public and private schools.&nbsp; In addition to providing handwriting instruction to students, Amy&nbsp;has provided&nbsp;workshops and consultation to school personnel, parents, and fellow occupational therapists.&nbsp; She also provides private occupational therapy to children.&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy holds a certificate&nbsp;for the &quot;Comprehensive Program in Sensory Integration&quot; and &nbsp;is&nbsp; a registered interactive metronome trainer (RIMT).</p>
		    <p><b><u>Instruction Assistants:</u></b>&nbsp; Though class sizes are limited to 8 students, any class with greater than 3 (and when indicated 2) students will have&nbsp; the trainned assistance of&nbsp;&nbsp;the <i>Handwriting Success</i>&nbsp;instruction assistants. The student to staff ratio is most often 2 students to each staff member.&nbsp;The instruction assistants are trained by Amy Carroll,OTR/L&nbsp; in the <i>Handwriting Success</i> approach to handwriting.&nbsp;The assistants&nbsp;are present in each class to help support the students during group activities and handwriting instruction.&nbsp;<br>
		      <i>Handwriting Success</i> carefully chooses the staff.&nbsp; Most of the assistants are currently college elementary education majors preparing for their internships in teaching!!&nbsp; They have found their&nbsp;work with students at <i>Handwriting Success</i> to be a very rewarding experience!&nbsp; It has been a true &quot;win -win&quot; to have these talented, enthusiastic people working with the students at Handwritng Success!!</p>
		    <p><b><u>Guest Teachers:</u></b>&nbsp; We at <i>Handwriting Success</i> have also been fortunate to have the experience of an elementary school teacher during our summer camp. The teacher has provided instruction to the students on that vital link to written expression. Many students that struggle (or have in the past) with the mechanics of writing also struggle with their ability to get thoughts on paper in a cohesive manner.&nbsp; The educator and the occupational therapist co-teach classes to assist students in this area</p>
