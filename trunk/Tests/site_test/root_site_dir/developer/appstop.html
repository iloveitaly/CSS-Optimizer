		<h3>What is it?</h3>
		<p><span class="picholder" style="width:247px;"><img src="images/ss/appstop-ss-1.jpg" alt="App Stop Menu Bar screen shot"></span>App Stop is a little status bar that resides in your menu bar that allows you to pause, resume, and set priorities for your applications. 
		When you pause an application is freezes it, keeping all the memory assoicated with the application intact but stopping the application from using any CPU cycles. 
		Resuming a paused application lets it once again use the CPU, essentially un-freezing it. For older machines with limited CPU, but an abundance of memory this is very usefull because it allows you to free up that precious CPU time to help other applications run faster. 
		Setting priority's for applications allows you to specify which applications should have 'first dibs' on the CPU, allowing some applications to run faster, while others simply run slower. 
		App Stop features a table view mode that allows you to select mutiple application to pause/continue, set CPU priority, as well as force-quit them. App Stop will also automatically continue all your processes when App Stop terminates.
