		<div class="content">
			My name is Michael Bianco, I have been doing web-development & programming for about the last two years. 
			I love programming and web-development, the field is constantly changing with new exciting technologies coming out almost every month. 
			The challenge of keeping up with those technologies and creating new innovative web content & computer applications is what fuels my love for this field.
			<p>I haven't ever taken a formal programming or design course, everything programming and design related that I know has been taught by myself. 
			To learn, I use an interative form of learning. If I am trying to learn a complex topic, I first read a book or on-line tutorial about the subject. 
			I then make a sample test demostrating and testing the concept I just learnged about. 
			I then repeat the process, reading deaper into the subject and extending the test case created making it more complex demostrating the deeper knowledge I have just obtained. 
			I have obtained knowledge of many programming concepts and languages by using this technique, and I believe I can learn any programming language or concept by using this process.</p>
