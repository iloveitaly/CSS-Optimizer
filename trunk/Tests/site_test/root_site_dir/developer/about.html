		<h3>What Is MAB?</h3>
		<p>You're probobly wondering what this 'MAB' thing is all about, it's nothing special, just my initials. If you wanted to know more than what MAB is, then keep reading.</p>
		<h3>This Site</h3><p>This site is an attempt to try to give something back to the web developer community that I have learned so much from, if it wasn't for those kind people who shared their hard work, I wouldn't be half as good as I am now. 
		I intend to release source code, and release some free computer programs that I have created/working on.</p>
		<h3>Who Am I?</h3><p>My name is Michael Bianco, i'm 100% percent Italian, and a devote Catholic.
		I live in the US and enjoy a plethora of outdoor activities my favorite being snowboarding, sailing, and soccer. 
		I love competition and enjoy playing strategy based games.</p>
		<p>Obviously, as you might have noticed from this web-site, and my <a href="http://mabwebdesign.com/" title="My freelance design site">Freelance Design Site</a>, I enjoy web-site designing and progamming.
		Programming is my favorite part of the web-development process, it never gets boring or old; there is always something more to discover or accomplish. I love problem solving and creating new web-applications, I thrive on challenge; give me a programming challenge or problem and i'll figure out a solution. 
		Although most of the programming I do has to do with the web, i'm delving into computer application programming and hope to release some small usefull applications to the public.
		I run Mac OS X 10.4 as my operating system, and I love it. Its great being able to access alot of Linux and open source software, but still being able to use applications like Photoshop and Macromedia Flash- the best of both worlds! I also enjoy creating music, although I am not very good at it (take <a href="random.html">A Look</a> at some music I've made).</p>
		<p>That about sums it up, hopefully you found some of this interesting. If your interested in having me tackle a web-development project for you, take a look at my <a href="http://mabwebdesign.com/">Freelance Site</a> to look at previous work I have completed, and what web development services I provide.
